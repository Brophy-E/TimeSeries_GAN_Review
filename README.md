# TimeSeries_GAN_Review
A Survey and Taxonomy of recent GANs developments in time series. 

Please refer to the details in our recent review paper [“Generative Adversarial Networks in Time Series: A Survey and Taxonomy”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11098.pdf) available on ArXiv and submitted for peer-review.

We have classified the time series GAN-variants into two research lines based on recent GAN developments. Below, we provide a summary and the demo code of these models.

## Discrete-variant time series GANs
